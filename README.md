# courtscraper

The purpose of the courtscraper app is to provide a better way to search for free courts at the UBC tennis center.  The current web interface requires the user to drill into each court to see what is available whereas courtscraper allows the user to pick a date and then see what court times are available for booking across all the courts at the UBC tennis center
